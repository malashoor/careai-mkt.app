 ⚠ The "experimental.esmExternals" option has been modified. experimental.esmExternals is not recommended to be modified as it may disrupt module resolution. It should be removed from your next.config.ts.
 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/moayed/Desktop/Projects/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /Users/moayed/Desktop/Projects/careai-site/marketing-site/package-lock.json

[Error: "next start" does not work with "output: export" configuration. Use "npx serve@latest out" instead.]
